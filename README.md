# age-recipient-pq

⚠️ **WARNING**

This crate has not been independently reviewed and audited by the `age` + `rage` maintainers. Use at your own risk, and consider its security properties carefully.

A Rust library providing post-quantum hybrid recipients and identities compatible with the age encryption format.

## Overview

This crate implements a post-quantum hybrid recipient and identity for the [age](https://github.com/str4d/rage) encryption tool. It combines ML-KEM-768 with X25519 for enhanced security against quantum attacks while maintaining compatibility with the age file format.

The library is designed for potential integration into the official `rage` CLI and libraries, using the `secrecy` crate for secret handling to align with Rage's conventions.
## Installation

Since this crate is for development use only and not published on crates.io, use it as a Git dependency.

Add the following to your `Cargo.toml`:

```toml
[dependencies]
age-recipient-pq = { git = "https://github.com/Slurp9187/age-recipient-pq" }
```

Replace `"your-username"` with the actual GitHub username or repository URL.

Then, run `cargo build` to include it.

## Usage

Generate a new recipient and identity pair:

```rust,no_run
use age_recipient_pq::{HybridRecipient, HybridIdentity};

let (recipient, identity) = HybridRecipient::generate().unwrap();
println!("Recipient: {}", recipient.to_string());
println!("Identity: {}", identity.to_string());
```

Parse from string:

```rust,no_run
use std::str::FromStr;

let recipient = HybridRecipient::from_str("age1pq1...").unwrap();
let identity = HybridIdentity::from_str("AGE-SECRET-KEY-PQ-1...").unwrap();
```

See the [API documentation](https://docs.rs/age-recipient-pq) for detailed usage and examples.

## Security

- Post-quantum security via ML-KEM-768 (NIST standardized).
- Hybrid design with X25519 for efficiency.
- Secrets are zeroized using the `secrecy` crate.

## Compatibility

- Fully compatible with the age file format.
- Designed for Rage integration without external dependencies.

## Testing

The test suite includes comprehensive coverage for key functionality:

- **Unit tests** (`hybrid_recipient_tests.rs`): Verify PQ key generation, serialization, parsing, and basic encrypt/decrypt roundtrips without external dependencies.
- **Stanza tests** (`pq_stanza_tests.rs`): Test low-level PQ stanza wrapping/unwrapping, error handling for malformed inputs, and multi-recipient encryption.
- **CLI interop tests** (`age_cli_interop_tests.rs`, `roundtrip_tests.rs`): Ensure full compatibility with the age CLI by encrypting with the library and decrypting with the CLI (and vice versa). These tests require the age CLI (>= v1.3.0 for PQ support) to be installed; if unavailable, the tests skip gracefully with a clear message.
- **Test data** (`tests/data/`): Contains sample files like `lorem.txt` (plaintext), `lorem.txt.age` (CLI-encrypted), and PQ keys for interop verification.

Run tests with `cargo test`. For CLI interop tests, use `cargo test -- --nocapture` to see skip messages if the age CLI is unavailable or incompatible.
